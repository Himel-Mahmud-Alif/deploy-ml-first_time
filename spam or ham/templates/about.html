    <h1>About SpamGuard</h1>
    <p>This web application is a demonstration of a machine learning model built to classify messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam" (often called "Ham").</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Built with the Flask web framework in Python.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Uses Scikit-learn to train a classifier on the SMS Spam Collection dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> Text messages are converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) before being fed to the model.</li>
        <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> The user interface is created with HTML, Jinja templating, and styled with custom CSS for a clean and modern look.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This project showcases a complete, end-to-end machine learning application, from data training to deployment as a web service.</p>
